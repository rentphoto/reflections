Viewing a diff between two versions of a file will help me see the bug that would introduced.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Having easy access to the entire history of a file give me the opportunity to easy reverse to my old version of file.

I think the pros of manually choosing to create a commit is opportunity to add a message to commit. You have mind
the optimal period of commit by yourself. Don't forget add commits at appropriate moment.

Some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit because often changes in coding
are in multiple files. But Google Docs treat each file separately. 
In order to view the history of files I can use git log to see the list of commits. To compare two commits I
can use git diff command. There are useful options for git log - --stat and --pretty=oneline.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Using version control make me more confident to make changes in my code because I can revert changed files to 
previous state.
