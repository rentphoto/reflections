When I initialize a repository in the my directory creates a new directory with meta data of git.
I need to do it because I want to have the history of project's changes and to be able revert in previous state. 
 
 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
 What value do you think it offers?
 
 Staging area is opportunity to commit only you need. 
 It's a intermediate area between working directory and repository.
